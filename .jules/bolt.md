## 2024-08-11 - Sequential Component Fetching Bottleneck
**Learning:** The vanilla JS architecture of this site loads HTML fragments for each section sequentially using a `for...await` loop. This creates an unnecessary waterfall of network requests that severely delays time-to-interactive.
**Action:** Replace sequential `for...await` loops with `Promise.all()` when fetching independent resources to enable concurrent loading and reduce total network time.

## 2024-08-11 - Lazy Loading Below-the-Fold Images
**Learning:** The landing page contained numerous images in the gallery, integrations, and support sections that were loading synchronously during the initial page load, creating network contention and delaying Time to Interactive (TTI). Adding the standard `loading="lazy"` attribute to these `<img>` tags fixes this issue efficiently without breaking the user experience.
**Action:** When implementing pages with long scrolls or galleries, always ensure images below the fold have `loading="lazy"` enabled.
